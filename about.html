                <h3 id="summary">Did you ever hear the tragedy of Fred The Baker? 
                    I thought not. It’s not a story any Baker would tell you. It’s a Baking legend. 
                    Fred the Baker was a Dark Lord of the Baking, so powerful and so wise he could 
                    use the Force to influence the flour to create bread... He had such a 
                    knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the donuts he cared about 
                    from going stale. The dark side of the Baking is a pathway to many abilities some 
                    consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid 
                    of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he 
                    taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his 
                    sleep. Ironic. He could save baking goods from getting stale, but not himself.</h3>
